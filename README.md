## Background

Congratulations! You’ve helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. But wait! The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:
The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout
Working from this module’s election_results.csv file, use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file.
Finally, you’ll provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.

Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line

## Summary
In order to analysis the election result, we were using the Python to read the CSV file, to identify the votes and analysis the perecentage and find out the winner. We create scripts to read the data from SCV file, and calculat the result that required from purpose. In the assignment, we were maily using listing, dictionary, loop, and conditions to do the analysis.
